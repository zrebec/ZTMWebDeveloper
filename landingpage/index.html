                  <p>Now that we've covered rabbits and hares, let's talk about bunnies. A bunny is not a species. It is
                  simply a term of endearment with a long history.</p>
                  <p>According to Dictionary.com, beginning sometime in the early 17th century, the word "bunny" was
                  used to refer to a young girl. The word bunny itself could be a derivative of the Scottish word bun
                  (rabbit, squirrel, tail of a hare) or from the French word bon (good). Gradually, the term bunny
                  expanded to describe not just young female humans, but also young and/or small animals. Nowadays, it
                  generally refers to a baby rabbit.</p>
                  <p>And there you have it. Now, armed with appropriate scientific and etymological knowledge, you can
                  use all three terms with confidence and flare. Trivia night, here you come!</p>

                class="description-image">
                <p>Hares and jackrabbits are leporids belonging to the genus Lepus. Hares are classified in the same family
                as rabbits. They are similar in size and form to rabbits and have similar herbivorous diets, but generally
                have longer ears and live solitarily or in pairs. Also unlike rabbits, their young are able to fend for
                themselves shortly after birth rather than emerging blind and helpless. Most are fast runners. Hare species
                are native to Africa, Eurasia and North America.</p>
                <p>Five leporid species with "hare" in their common names are not considered true hares: the hispid hare
                (Caprolagus hispidus), and four species known as red rock hares (comprising Pronolagus). Conversely,
                jackrabbits are hares, rather than rabbits.</p>
                <p>A hare less than one year old is called a leveret. A group of hares is called a "drove".</p>

                <h4>Biology</h4>
                <p>Hares are swift animals and can run up to 80 km/h (50 mph) over short distances. Over longer
                distances, the European hare (Lepus europaeus) can run up to 56 km/h (35 mph). The five species of
                jackrabbits found in central and western North America are able to run at 64 km/h (40 mph) over longer
                distances, and can leap up to 3 m (10 ft) at a time.</p>
                <p>Normally a shy animal, the European brown hare changes its behavior in spring, when they can be seen in
                daytime chasing one another. This appears to be competition between males to attain dominance for breeding.
                During this spring frenzy, animals of both sexes can be seen "boxing", one hare striking another with its
                paws. This behavior gives rise to the idiom mad as a March hare.
                This is present not only in intermale competition, but also among females toward males to prevent
                copulation.</p>

                <h4>Differences from rabbits</h4>
                <p>Hares do not bear their young below ground in a burrow as do other leporids, but rather in a shallow
                depression or flattened nest of grass called a form. Young hares are adapted to the lack of physical
                protection, relative to that afforded by a burrow, by being born fully furred and with eyes open. They are
                hence precocial, and are able to fend for themselves soon after birth. By contrast, rabbits are altricial,
                having young that are born blind and hairless.</p>
                <p>All rabbits (except the cottontail rabbits) live underground in burrows or warrens, while hares (and
                cottontail rabbits) live in simple nests above the ground, and usually do not live in groups. Hares are
                generally larger than rabbits, with longer ears, and have black markings on their fur. Hares have not been
                domesticated, while rabbits are raised for food and kept as house pets. The domestic pet known as the
                Belgian Hare is a rabbit that has been selectively bred to resemble a hare.</p>
                <p>Hares have jointed, or kinetic, skulls, unique among mammals. They have 48 chromosomes while rabbits
                have 44.</p>

                  <img 
                  src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Oryctolagus_cuniculus_Rcdo.jpg/1024px-Oryctolagus_cuniculus_Rcdo.jpg"
                  alt="Rabbit illustration from Wikipedia"
                  class="description-image">
                  <p>Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha (along with the hare and
                  the pika). Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, the world's
                  305 breeds of domestic rabbit. Sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit species, among them the seven types
                  of cottontail. The European rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica, is
                  familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet.
                  With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit (or bunny) is, in many areas of the
                  world, a part of daily lifeâ€”as food, clothing, a companion, and as a source of artistic inspiration.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Terminology</h4>
                  <p>Male rabbits are called bucks; females are called does. An older term for an adult rabbit is coney
                  (derived ultimately from the Latin cuniculus), while rabbit once referred only to the young animals.
                  Another term for a young rabbit is bunny, though this term is often applied informally (particularly
                  by children) to rabbits generally, especially domestic ones. More recently, the term kit or kitten has
                  been used to refer to a young rabbit.</p>
                  <h4>Differences from hares</h4>
                  <p>Hares are precocial, born relatively mature and mobile with hair and good vision, while rabbits are
                  altricial, born hairless and blind, and requiring closer care. Hares (and cottontail rabbits) live a
                  relatively solitary life in a simple nest above the ground, while most rabbits live in social groups
                  in burrows or warrens. Hares are generally larger than rabbits, with ears that are more elongated,
                  and with hind legs that are larger and longer. Hares have not been domesticated, while descendants of
                  the European rabbit are commonly bred as livestock and kept as pets.</p>
                  <h4>Evolution</h4>
                  <p>Because the rabbit's epiglottis is engaged over the soft palate except when swallowing, the rabbit
                  is an obligate nasal breather. Rabbits have two sets of incisor teeth, one behind the other. This way
                  they can be distinguished from rodents, with which they are often confused. Carl Linnaeus originally
                  grouped rabbits and rodents under the class Glires; later, they were separated as the scientific
                  consensus is that many of their similarities were a result of convergent evolution. However, recent
                  DNA analysis and the discovery of a common ancestor has supported the view that they do share a common
                  lineage, and thus rabbits and rodents are now often referred to together as members of the superorder
                  Glires.</p>
                  <h4>Ears</h4>
                  <p>Within the order lagomorphs, the ears are utilized to detect and avoid predators. In the family
                  leporidae, the ears are typically longer than they are wide. For example, in black tailed jack
                  rabbits, their long ears cover a greater surface area relative to their body size that allow them to
                  detect predators from far away. Contrasted to cotton tailed rabbits, their ears are smaller and
                  shorter, requiring predators to be closer to detect them before they can flee. Evolution has favored
                  rabbits to have shorter ears so the larger surface area does not cause them to lose heat in more
                  temperate regions. The opposite can be seen in rabbits that live in hotter climates, mainly because
                  they possess longer ears that have a larger surface area that help with dispersion of heat as well as
                  the theory that sound does not travel well in more arid air, opposed to cooler air. Therefore, longer
                  ears are meant to aid the organism in detecting predators sooner rather than later in warmer
                  temperatures. The rabbit is characterized by its shorter ears while hares are characterized by their
                  longer ears. Rabbits' ears are an important structure to aid thermoregulation and detect predators due
                  to how the outer, middle, and inner ear muscles coordinate with one another. The ear muscles also aid
                  in maintaining balance and movement when fleeing predators.</p>
